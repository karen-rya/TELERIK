# Telerik Reporting Virtual Classroom Training Starter Project

Welcome to the sample project repository of the
[Telerik Reporting getting started video course](https://learn.telerik.com/learn/course/internal/view/elearning/38/telerik-reporting).
This training course is developed to help you get started with the Telerik Reporting set of services and features.
It aims to put you in the shoes of a report designer and an engineer that is integrating a reporting solution into an existing application.

In this repo, you will find the starter source code needed for the hands-on exercises that are part of the different chapters throughout the training.
You will also find two final states of the exercises in branches of this repository:
* [basic-complete](https://github.com/telerik/RpsTrackerBlazorReportingStart/tree/basics-complete) contains the state of the exercises when you complete chapter 3 
* [advanced-complete](https://github.com/telerik/RpsTrackerBlazorReportingStart/tree/advanced-complete) contains the state of the exercises
when you complete the next chapters
